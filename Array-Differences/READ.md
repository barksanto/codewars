# Code Wars Challenges

Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

Every morning I challenge myself to complete 1 coding challenge.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

I primarily use JS in my day to day, so this is my preferred tool to upskill with these challenges.

## Optimizations

Each challenge includes an initial solution along with refactored code and notes for each iteration/ attempt I make.

## Lessons Learned:

There's usually a way to improve my written code. Whether it's initially too verbose, or diffucult to understand, I do my best to make improvements on each attempt.

<!-- ## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
