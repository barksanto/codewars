# Code Wars Challenges

Every morning I challenge myself to complete 1 coding challenge.

**Tech used:** JavaScript

I primarily use JS in my day to day, so this is my preferred tool to upskill with these challenges.

## Optimizations

Each challenge includes an initial solution along with refactored code and notes for each iteration/ attempt I make.

## Lessons Learned:

There's usually a way to improve my written code. Whether it's initially too verbose, or diffucult to understand, I do my best to make improvements on each attempt.
