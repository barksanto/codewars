<p>
  write a function that returns the positions and the values of the "peaks" (or local maxima) of a numeric array.
  
  For example, the array arr = [0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 0] has a peak at position 3 with a value of 5 (since arr[3] equals 5).
  
  The output will be returned as an object with two properties: pos and peaks. Both of these properties should be arrays.
  If there is no peak in the given array, then the output should be {pos: [], peaks: []}
